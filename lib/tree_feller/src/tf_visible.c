// The visible-node filter: a raw sink that applies tree-sitter's visibility,
// alias and field rules and forwards what survives.
//
// Three rules do the work, all of them tree-sitter's:
//   * a child is visible iff its own symbol is visible or the parent's production
//     aliases it (node.c:/ts_node__is_relevant/);
//   * a hidden child contributes its own visible children in its place, so
//     `_expression` and `aux_sym_*_repeat1` disappear and their contents are
//     inlined into the nearest visible ancestor;
//   * aliases and fields are indexed by `structural_index`, which counts only
//     non-extra children (subtree.c:437).
